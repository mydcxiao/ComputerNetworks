g++

# check which process is using your network
# you don't have to understand it completely right now.
# but when you start working on your projects, you might use these commands
sudo su
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN
lsof -i:22 ## see a specific port such as 22 ##
kill -9 {your_process_id}
